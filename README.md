# AI Collateral Manager

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered collateral manager designed to streamline loan management and portfolio risk assessment. Built using the Claude AI model integrated with LangChain, the agent dynamically trades loans based on risk metrics derived from the user's portfolio. All trading operations are executed on the Solana blockchain, ensuring fast, secure, and decentralized transactions. The risk metrics are informed by logic inspired by [this post from Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/articles/risk-analysis-of-crypto-assets/). The application is hosted on AWS for scalability and reliability.

## Features
- **Account Management**: Users can create an account to manage their portfolio and loans.
- **Loan Issuance**: The agent provides loans based on the collateral submitted by users.
- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: The agent evaluates portfolio risk using advanced metrics to guide trading decisions.
- **Automated Trading**: All trades are executed on the Solana blockchain, leveraging its speed and low transaction costs.
- **Cloud Hosting**: The system is deployed on AWS for high availability and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **Claude AI Model**: For powering the AI agent’s reasoning and decision-making.
- **LangChain**: Provides the structural framework for the agent.
- **Solana Blockchain**: Handles all trading operations.
- **AWS**: Hosts the agent and supporting infrastructure.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the application’s local URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
2. Create an account and log in.
3. Submit your collateral and request a loan.
4. The AI agent will:
   - Evaluate your portfolio risk.
   - Trade the loan amount based on dynamic risk metrics.
5. Monitor your portfolio and loan performance directly from the dashboard.

## Risk Metrics
The risk assessment logic is inspired by [Two Sigma’s methodology for crypto assets](https://www.twosigma.com/articles/risk-analysis-of-crypto-assets/). The agent dynamically adjusts its trading strategy based on:
- Volatility of the assets in the portfolio.
- Correlations between assets.
- Historical performance trends.

## Deployment
The application is hosted on AWS. Follow these steps to deploy:
1. Package the application for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy the build to AWS (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, or a containerized solution).
3. Set up environment variables for AWS credentials, Solana integration, and other required configurations.
